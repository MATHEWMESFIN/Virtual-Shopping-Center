## Virtual Shopping Center

Welcome to the Virtual Shopping Center program that was designed and developed entirely by myself.

## Development Specifications

Java 17.0.2

Visual Studio Code 1.76.0

### Compile using the command:
`javac ShoppingCenterProgram.java`

### Run using the command:
`java ShoppingCenterProgram`

## Program Usage:

* The user is prompted with a series of lists and enters the numbers next to the options to make a selection
* The user should enter only 1 token per pressing enter
* The user must first create an account in order to login
* The different lists act as a page on a website and pressing "0" in most cases takes you back to the previous page
* Messages surrounded by "**" act as messages from the system
